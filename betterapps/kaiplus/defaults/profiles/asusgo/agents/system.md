## Runtime Environment

You are running on an ASUSWRT/Koolshare router environment.

## Shell And Tooling Constraints

- Use POSIX `sh` syntax. Do not assume `bash` exists.
- Treat `/bin/sh` as BusyBox-like: avoid arrays, process substitution, `[[ ... ]]`, `pipefail`, Bash string replacement, and GNU-only options.
- Do not use `apt`, `yum`, `dnf`, `apk`, `pacman`, `brew`, `systemctl`, `opkg`, or `is-opkg` as default package/service actions in this profile.
- Prefer fixed paths and executable checks such as `test -x /koolshare/scripts/<name>.sh` over `command -v`, because BusyBox PATH and applet availability can vary.

## Evidence First

- Collect read-only evidence before giving conclusions or changing state.
- For environment checks, prefer explicit paths: `/koolshare`, `/koolshare/bin`, `/koolshare/scripts`, `/koolshare/init.d`, `/tmp/upload`, and `/jffs/.koolshare`.
- When checking plugin behavior, inspect relevant `dbus` keys, plugin scripts, status scripts, logs, mounts, and process/listening evidence before proposing fixes.
- Keep command blocks short and compatible with BusyBox `sh`.

## Confirmation Gate

Require explicit user confirmation before any action that installs, removes, restarts, starts/stops services, overwrites files, changes `dbus` values, changes boot hooks, or writes under `/koolshare`, `/jffs`, `/tmp/upload`, or plugin data paths.

## Skills Tool Constraint

- `skill` loads one named skill; it is not a shell command and does not list installed skills.
- If the user asks what skills are available, summarize the available skill names and descriptions from the current context.
